# one-among-crowds
A model of persons moving through crowds (i.e. students on campus or tourists in London).

BTW I'm kind of embarrassed to have this on GitHub. It's a project I've been meaning to work on for a long time now, but I haven't been able to put any time into it yet. :/

## About
The idea for this project stemmed from walking around Iowa State University and seeing the students interact on their way to class. Each has a destination in mind, a time fram for arrival, and a walking pace. There are so many factors that are in play. Similarly, visiting London adds a whole new layer: people walking, buses driving, trains travelling, and boats sailing.

The intent of this project is to model the movement of people/vehicles using C. The exact implementation is still up in the air, but will be resolved as features are added.

## Ideas
Here is a list of features, listed in (rough) order of implementation.

### Phase 1
 - a map of an area
   - simple 2D drawing, code complete
   - visual representation of the map
   - one type of terrain
 - a model of a person
   - location
   - speed
   - direction
   - destination
   - time frame
 - passing of time
   - What kind of strategy to use?
   - Weigh the pros and cons of each

### Phase 2
 - a change in terrain
   - preferred routes
   - avoided areas
   - grassy areas
   - colors for each
 - visible features of persons
   - color
   - size
   - name

### Phase 3
 - how a person avoids other people when walking towards them
 - grouping of people
 - list of friends on a person
 - how likely a person would be to stop and talk to a given other person
 - group dynamics walking to a destination

### Phase 4
 - multiple layers (to represent subways, roadways, rivers, etc.)
 - vehicles
   - buses
   - cars
   - bikes
   - roller blades
   - trains
   - subways
   - boats
   - horses

### Phase 5
 - Points of Interest
 - Public transportation hubs
 - Public transportation schedules
 - various other "destinations"

### Phase 6
 - Tourists
   - how prepared they are
   - routes to points/intentional wandering
   - bank accounts to purchase public transportation
 - Bus tours
 - river cruises
